# Google_Data_Analytics_CaseStudy02

---

If you are here with the intention of copying how this case study was done, I recommend that you do your first one, trying to look for the steps and procedures in your own notes that were made throughout the course.

The case study offers some guide questions, which can be difficult to answer (I even used chatGPT to answer questions about some of them). That's why I recommend again that you try to answer them, always trying to make an effort to understand them and give an answer that is originally yours.

Furthermore, if you have already done it and want something to compare it with, you can go see how I did the case study.

This repository contains the second case study made for the capstone project of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course offered on Coursera.

In this case study, we analyze the behavior of users who use gadgets to evaluate data about their health, such as steps, calories burned, intensities, time and distances in activities.

Yes, the course teaches R and I did the case study in python.
